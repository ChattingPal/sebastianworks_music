            <div class="container">
            <p style="width: 300px;">Sebastian E. Berg is not well known, but he is in his local area.
            Sebastian has also started his own record label where he releases music from.
            I currently can't tell which artists yet! But the time will come</p>
            <br>
            <p style="width: 300px;">Sebastian Berg is ethnic/nationality from Faroe Islands, but
            lives in Denmark. Sebastians first release was Sleeping Angel, a relaxing pop song.
            Although Sebastian makes Eurodance/Gabber, he wanted to try one of his old songs.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="width: 300px;">Materials Sebastian Use: FL Studio Producer for Music
            BandLab for Vocals. Distributor DistroKid, which by the way is an easy and cheap
            distribution platform for music, recommendable!</p>
